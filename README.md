# vulkano_blas

- [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/cogent)
- [Documentation](https://docs.rs/cogent/)

## Crate status

Currently due to the limitations of Vulkano very few BLAS operations can be implemented ([my issue on GitHub concerning this](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/1395)).

All shaders I am certain I will implement but cannot implement at the moment due to this limitation are marked as deprecated.

I hope perhaps this crate while at the moment extremely limited might spike some interest and motiviation in the topic.~~~~

## Installation

1. [Install Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano#setup)
2. Add `vulkano_blas = "0.1"` to `Cargo.toml`.
